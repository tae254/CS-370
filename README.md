Working on the captivating adventure of the pirate treasure hunt game proved to be an enjoyable endeavor. The project entailed the development of a cutting-edge Deep Q-Learning algorithm, employing a dual neural network configuration to navigate the intricate maze towards the elusive "treasure." Positioned at the maze's upper left corner, the "pirate" agent sought to reach the treasure nestled in the lower right corner. By approximating the values of the Q-Table through the DQN, meticulously crafted manually inputs were replaced. Armed with these learned values, the pirate agent adeptly determined the optimal direction to successfully conquer the maze.

The Jupyter Notebook file provided the foundational code for this undertaking, serving as a springboard for the DQN implementation. While initially consisting of pseudocode, my task entailed completion and fine-tuning to enable network "learning" for the agent's seamless maze navigation. Extensive research from various textbooks and online resources augmented my understanding, culminating in the creation of an original code that drew inspiration from diverse sources. To encapsulate the project's intricacies, a comprehensive Design Defense document was meticulously composed, shedding light on the distinctive workings of the DQN in contrast to conventional Reinforcement Learning methodologies without the integration of a DQN.


I approach problems by following a systematic and analytical approach. I start by clearly understanding the problem statement and requirements. Then, I break down the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems. I research and gather relevant information and explore existing solutions or algorithms that can be applied. I analyze the problem domain and design an appropriate solution using suitable data structures and algorithms. I implement and test the solution, debugging and refining it as needed.
